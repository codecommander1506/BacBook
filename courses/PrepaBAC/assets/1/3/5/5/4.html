<center>DIRECT AND INDIRECT (OR REPORTED) SPEECH.</center>
<center><h3><font color="#c70000">INTRODUCTION</font></h3></center>

There are two ways of relating what a person has said: direct and indirect.<br><br>
In direct speech we repeat the original speaker’s exact words :<br>
<strong>He said, “I have lost my umbrella.”</strong> <br><br>
Remarks thus repeated are placed between inverted commas, and a comma is placed immediately before the remark. Direct speech is found in conversations in books, in plays and in quotations.<br><br>
In indirect speech we give the exact meaning of a remark or a speech, without necessarily using the speaker’s exact words :<br>
<strong>He said (that) he had lost his umbrella.</strong><br><br>
There is no comma after say in indirect speech. that can usually be omitted after say and tell + object. But it should be kept after other verbs: complain, explain, object, point out, protest etc. Indirect speech is normally used when conversation is reported verbally, though direct speech is sometimes here to give a more dramatic effect.<br>
When we turn direct speech into indirect, some changes are usually necessary.<br>
PRONOUNS AND ADJECTIVES: CHANGES NECESSARY

<center><h5><font color="#c70000">A. First and second person pronouns and possessive adjectives normally</font></h5></center>

change to the third person except when the speaker is reporting his own words. <strong>(I = he, she | me = him, her | my = his, her | mine = his, hers | we = they...)</strong><br>
She said, “he’s <strong>my</strong> son”. → She said that he was <strong>her</strong> son.<br>
“<strong>I</strong>’m ill”, she said. → She said that <strong>she</strong> was ill.

<strong>Direct question</strong>: He said, “Where is she going?”<br>

He said, ”Mary, when is the next train?” → He asked Mary when the next train was.<br><br>
2. If the direct question begins with a question word (<strong>when, where, who, how, why etc.</strong>) the question word is repeated in the indirect question:<br>
He said, “Why didn’t you put on the brake?” → He asked (<strong>her</strong>) why she hadn’t put on the brake.<br>
