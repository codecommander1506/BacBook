    <strong>Either / or</strong> versus <strong>Neither / nor</strong><br><br>
    1- <strong>Either / or</strong><br>
    used in a sentence in the affirmative sense<br>
    when referring to a choice between two possibilities<br>
    Ex: We can <strong>either</strong> eat now <strong>or</strong> after the show - it's up to you.<br><br>
    2- <strong>Neither / nor</strong><br>
    used in a sentence in the negative sense<br>
    when you want to say that two or more things are not true<br>
    Ex: <strong>Neither</strong> my mother <strong>nor</strong> my father went to university.<br><br>
    <strong>Singular or plural</strong><br>
    When using either/or and neither/nor, note the following rules:<br><br>
    1. <strong>If both elements are singular, then the verb is singular too</strong>.<br>
    Either the father or the mother has to attend the meeting.<br>
    (father and mother are singular; so the verb has is singular too)<br>
    Neither Leila nor Nancy is going to write the report.<br>
    (Leila and Nancy are singular; so the verb is singular too)<br><br>
    2. <strong>However, if one of the elements is plural, then use a plural verb</strong>.<br>
    Either Sue or the girls are going to prepare dinner tonight.(the girls is plural; so the verb are is plural too)<br>
    Neither the teacher nor the students were in the classroom this morning.<br>
    (the students is plural; so the verb were is plural too)<br><br>
    <strong><i>NOTE</i></strong>: <strong>Either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong> can also come at the beginning of a sentence.<br><br>
    <strong><i>Examples</i></strong>:<br>
    <strong>Either</strong> we will go out, or we will stay at home.<br>
    <strong>Neither</strong> of the restaurants is open today.<br>
